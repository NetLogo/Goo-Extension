# NetLogo Goo extension

This extension lets you manipulate the GUI widgets in NetLogo's Interface tab.  "GUI", hence "Goo".

## Use

The provided primitives are:
 * `goo:chooser-items` (reporter)
 * `goo:set-chooser-items` (command)

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to point to your NetLogo directory (containing NetLogo.jar)
and SCALA_HOME to point to your Scala 2.8.1 installation:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0beta2 SCALA_HOME=/usr/local/scala-2.8.1.final make

If compilation succeeds, `goo.jar` will be created.

## Credits

Thanks to Eric Russell for providing the initial version of the chooser primitives.
