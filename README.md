# NetLogo Goo extension

This extension lets you manipulate the GUI widgets in NetLogo's Interface tab.  "GUI", hence "Goo".

This version of the extension requires (exactly) NetLogo 5.0beta2.

See the "Downloads" link here on GitHub for a zip archive you can download.

## Development status

Preliminary.  Known shortcomings include:

 * Do all primitives work with all widget types?  Don't know, hasn't been tested.
 * The format of the strings you pass to `goo:add` isn't documented yet. You can grab examples from any NetLogo model file.
 * `goo:add` requires a `goo:recompile` afterwards for at least some widget types (buttons yes, notes no). This could be improved.
 * ...?

## Usage

We'll fix this for NetLogo 5.0beta3, but at the moment, for this to work you need to replace the `scala-library.jar` file in the lib directory of your NetLogo application directory with the `scala-library.jar` file from Scala 2.8.1.  You can copy it from your Scala 2.8.1 installation, or grab it from this URL: `http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.8.1/scala-library-2.8.1.jar`

The provided primitives are:

 * `goo:show name` (command)
 * `goo:hide name` (command)
 * `goo:move name x-offset y-offset` (command)
 * `goo:add spec` (command)
 * `goo:recompile` (command) --- as a side effect, halts the model
 * `goo:chooser-items` (reporter)
 * `goo:set-chooser-items` (command)

All of these are demonstrated in the included "Goo Tester" model.

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to point to your NetLogo directory (containing NetLogo.jar) and SCALA_HOME to point to your Scala 2.8.1 installation.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0beta2 SCALA_HOME=/usr/local/scala-2.8.1.final make

If compilation succeeds, `goo.jar` will be created.

## Credits

Thanks to Eric Russell for providing the initial version of the chooser primitives.
